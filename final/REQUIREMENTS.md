# Final Project Requirements

* Your project is submitted as PR to merge your branch 'final-project' into main
  - This is similar to your other project submissions
  - I am not listing all the steps here so you can see if you understand the process of creating a branch, pushing it, and creating a PR
  - You will likely use the same process to submit work in your future jobs
* Be sure to include the reviewer(s) on your PR
* Project is **Due Mon Dec 11, 11:59pm PT**

## Structural Requirements
* Projects are individual (no groups)
* Project must be based in this directory
    * THIS directory (the one containing the REQUIREMENTS.md file) must be able to run the startup commands
      - Hint: use `npm create vite . -- --template react` to create files in this directory
        - This tells vite to use the current folder (`.`) instead of creating a new project folder
        - The command will ask if it should overwrite files, say Y
        - Doing so will overwrite this file
        - This file can be recreated after the vite project is created by running `git restore REQUIREMENTS.md`
* The project must run with `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm start`
    - Note the extra requirements about `npm start` below!
      - It should NOT start the vite dev server
      - It should start your single `server.js` that will run both your static SPA and your REST services
    - You may define additional commands as options, but running the above commands only must work
* Any `package.json` files you write should be well organized and complete
    * Fill in fields accurately
    * Use `dependencies` and `devDependencies` appropriately
    * Configure `scripts` appropriately
* Your project should use `npm`, not `yarn`
* Your project should NOT include files not appropriate
  - Do not commit `node_modules/` or `dist/`, for example
  - Vite will automatically provide a `.gitignore` file to do this, you just need to not mess it up
* The project CANNOT use `npm start` to run `vite` or `npm run dev` 
    * You must use Vite to create and develop your application
    * You will have to adjust the `scripts` section of `package.json` 
    * Serve the results of `npm run build` as static files in your server (which starts with `npm start`)
    * This is how the production use of your project would work

## Front End
* The project must use a React-based front end
* The project must be a Vite-based SPA and an express-based NodeJS server
* Your front end code must follow all the best practices as outlined in classes and in PR feedback
* Your front end code may include ONLY outside libs listed here, unless you get advance approval
    * react, react-dom, vite, and the libraries that vite installs
    * uuid
    * icon/image libraries that DO NOT use JS
    * jest, enzyme, @testing-library/react, chai, sinon, tape
* Advance approval will NOT be granted for:
    * SASS/less
    * CSS preprocessors
    * Bootstrap/Foundation/similar libraries
    * axios and other fetch() alternatives
    * jQuery or other non-react DOM manipulation

## Services
* Your backend/service code must use express-based NodeJS
* The project must involve calling REST-based service calls that you write
    * You may call outside services as well, but you must use some services you write
    * Your service calls (the ones you wrote) must include at least 3 different HTTP methods in a RESTful way
- You must use fetch() and promises directly (NO async/await)
  - Not because async/await is bad, but because I want to see that you understand promises themselves
* Your backend code must follow the best practices as outlined in classes and in PR feedback 
* Your backend code may include ONLY outside libs listed here, unless you get __advance__ approval
    * express
    * cookie-parser, uuid
    * nodemon (development only)
    * eslint, prettier, babel
    * jest, mocha, chai, sinon, tape
* Advance approval will NOT be granted for:
    - react-router, react-router-dom, react-reach, @tanstack/router
    * SASS/less
    * CSS preprocessors
    * Bootstrap/Foundation/similar libraries
    * Database libraries
    * axios and other fetch() alternatives
    * jQuery or other non-react DOM manipulation

## Functionality and Creativity 
* Your project must do something useful and/or interesting
* Your project must be usable and attractive
* Your project must have some form of input validation (front end AND back end)
* Your project must have some form of helpful error reporting (to the user, on screen)
* Your project may be considered for the college to exhibit - projects that meet that criteria are scoring very well for functionality and creativity
* Because I am banning routing libraries like react-router, the app is NOT expected to handle the Back button or maintaining the current front-end state on page reload/refresh

## README
* You must include a README.md in your project
* Your README must include a good and useful description of what your project does
* Your README must include a basic description of how to use your project
    * Your project shouldn't **require** someone read the README to understand how to use it (discoverable functionality)
* You must indicate the source and licensing of any outside images/media in your README

## Security requirements
- Users must have an authentication step
    - No actual passwords are checked, but the step must happen
      - Banning user "dog" counts IF you treat it differently from invalid characters in the username
        - Instead treat the user as not having enough permissions
    - There must be some case where authentication is denied (such as banning user "dog")
    - The step should be clearly distinct as when any authentication happen
    - The server must respond with some sort of token/session id for the client to use for authentication/authorization
      - A session id cookie counts
- All service calls must have some form of authorization (unless the service call is intended to allow open access)
    - passing a token that is validated on the server side
    - token may be passed as a cookie or as a header
- All security best practices from classes must be followed
    - In particular, various insertion attacks (XSS, etc)
      - React will do MOST of this automatically on the front end, but the backend MUST sanitize user input
    - Exception: We aren't worried about requiring HTTPS
- Do NOT store or ask for any passwords in any way
    - You can completely omit passwords, or you can ask for a password and not check it
    - You CAN require that a password be given (not ''), but SHOULD NOT check passwords for any other specific value or pattern
    - This is because we have learned that writing our own password storage/use is poor security unless we specialize in that

## Extra Credit Opportunities 
Note: worry about the base requirements first!
- More complex service interactions beyond the minimum
  - Different HTTP methods (used in an appropriate RESTful way)
  - Polling when appropriate to the application
    - Remember to perform clean up of any intervals!
  - Services with pagination
  - Different levels of authorization (users not yet logged in, logged in users, logged in administrators) able to use different services or get different results from those services
    - As we don't have passwords, this would be based on the user name
- UI interactions that require state management
  - Different "pages" and screens 
    - Note: react-router is NOT allowed, you will have to do conditional rendering yourself
        - Not because react-router (or other router libraries) are BAD, but because I want to see you demonstrate YOUR understanding
        - Handling the "Back" button isn't required, but doing so is an opportunity for extra credit
  - The larger the number of visual states that are possible (and managed correctly), the more impressive the work
  - Complex form validation with visual feedback to the user 
- Excellent architecture and separation of concerns
  - Good use of useReducer to update state via "action" concepts
